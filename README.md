## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-better-image

#or

npm install react-native-better-image
```

## Usage

```js
import BetterImage from 'react-native-better-image';

// ...

<BetterImage
  viewStyle={style}
  source={{
    uri: // image uri
  }}
  thumbnailSource={{
    uri: // thumbnail uri - will be displayed till image is loaded
  }}
  fallbackSource={{
    uri: // fallback image if original image fails to load
  }}
  // ...all other react-native image props
/>
```

## Motivation

React Native only includes a basic image component. I used to try solutions like [react-native-fast-image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) but none actually worked for the two of my most important issues:

- Lack of a fallback placeholder
- Progressive image loading (especially for banners & cover images)

This library solves two of these important issues by providing a fallbackSource & a thumbnailSource prop. If you need more features, feel free to raise an issue or send a PR ✨ I'd be happy to help 👍
